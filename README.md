# SpacexApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.19.

## NOTE 

The last filter for `land success` will not work as there was no such key or its corresponding values were present in the response from the API. Rest all functionalities of FILTERING the UI are working as required.

Images url provided in the API were blocked and gave no response, so i have added local images to the view.
